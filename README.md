### `MazeGame` :video_game:
MazeGame by Rico, Emilio &amp; Monty

This little maze game is a school project programmed in Python using PyGameZero.

For the generation of the labyinth we used https://github.com/boppreh/maze.

✨ A special thanks also goes to our teacher for the generous assistance! ✨

### `Execution`
To start the game you only need the file `console.py`, `maze.py` (For the maze generation),<br>
the `two folders "images" and "sounds"` and either `main_keyboard.py` or `main_controller.py`.<br>
Probably most people will only be able to use `main_keyboard.py`,<br>
because the other variant was only written for the controller built in class.<br>
There are no required dependencies<br>
<br>
From our extensive testing, it appears that the game still suffers from some bugs, but so far works smoothly on both Linux and Windows.
The file "Zwischenspeicher.py" has no use and is only for temporarily used code snippets.<br>
<br>
Have fun! :wink:
